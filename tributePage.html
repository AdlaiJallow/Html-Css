    <h3>First of two Mandela events</h3>
    <p>May 10, 1994 — Nelson Mandela became the first black president of South Africa after democratic 
      elections, taking the oath of office at the Union Buildings in Pretoria, the South African capital.
      Leaders and other dignitaries from around the world attended the historic occasion, which offered
      many South Africans another chance to celebrate in the streets.
      At the close of his inauguration speech, Mandela said: “Never, never and never again shall it be 
      that this beautiful land will again experience the oppression of one by another and suffer the 
      indignity of being the skunk of the world,” he said. “Let freedom reign. The sun shall never set 
      on so glorious a human achievement! God bless Africa! Thank you.”</p>
      <p>
        Mandela had kept a low profile during the month-long tournament, deciding against attending the 
        opener June 11 after the death of his great-grand daughter in a traffic accident following a World 
        Cup concert.

        The former president did not address the crowd on that emotional day in the stadium. It was his
        last public appearance.

        June 8, 2013 — The government says Mandela is admitted to a hospital with a recurring lung 
        infection. Officials describe his condition as serious but stable.

        December 5, 2013 — Mandela dies at age 95.
